<p class="tb"><i>On the level land near the junction of the Laramie and
North Platte Rivers stands Fort Laramie, long a landmark and
symbol of the Old West. Situated at a strategic point on a natural route
of travel, the site early attracted the attention of trail-blazing fur trappers,
who established the first fort. In later years it offered protection
and refreshment to the throngs who made the great western migrations
over the Oregon Trail. It was a station for the Pony Express and
the Overland Stage. It served as an important base in the conquest
of the Plains Indians, and it witnessed the development of the open
range cattle industry, the coming of the homesteaders, and the final
settlement which marked the closing of the frontier. Perhaps no other
single site is so intimately connected with the history of the Old West
in all its phases.</i></p>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small"><i>Early Fur Trade on the Platte, 1812-30</i></span></h2>
<p>American and French Canadian fur traders and trappers, exploring
the land, traveled the North Platte Route intermittently for over two
decades before the original fort was established at the mouth of the
Laramie River. First to mention the well-wooded stream flowing into
the North Platte River from the southwest was Robert Stuart, leader
of the seven &ldquo;Returning Astorians&rdquo; on their path-breaking journey
from Astoria at the mouth of the Columbia River to St. Louis, by way
of South Pass in the Rockies and the valley of the Platte, during the
winter of 1812-13. They journeyed eastward over what was to become
the greatest roadway to the West, thus entitling them to recognition
as the discoverers of the Oregon Trail.</p>
<p>Records of actual fur trade activity in this area for the next 10 years
are extremely meager, but many geographical names bear witness to
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
the gradual westward movement of the beaver hunters, some of them
undoubtedly of Canadian origin. Among them was Jacques La Ramee
who, according to tradition, was killed by Indians in 1821 on the stream
which now bears his name and which was destined to become the
setting of Fort Laramie. Famous only in death, his name was to be
given also to a plains region, a peak, a mountain range, a town, a city,
and a county in Wyoming.</p>
<p>In 1823, Jim Bridger, Jedediah Smith, and other enterprising trappers
of the Rocky Mountain Fur Co., going overland from the upper
Missouri, rediscovered South Pass and the lush beaver country west
of the Continental Divide. In 1824, while taking furs back to &ldquo;the
States,&rdquo; a band of &ldquo;mountain men&rdquo; under Thomas Fitzpatrick became
the first Americans of record to pass the mouth of the Laramie after
the Astorians. For 15 years thereafter the St. Louis traders sent supply
trains up the North Platte route to the annual trappers&rsquo; rendezvous,
usually held in the valleys of the Green or Wind Rivers. In 1830, William
Sublette, with supplies for the rendezvous on the Wind River,
took the first wagons over the greater part of what was to become the
Oregon Trail.</p>

</div>
<p>The Laramie and its tributaries were also the homes of the prized
beaver, and much trading was done at the pleasant campsites near
its mouth. Here, too, was the junction with the trappers&rsquo; trail to Taos.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small"><i>Fort William, the First &ldquo;Fort Laramie,&rdquo; 1834</i></span></h2>
<p>The advantages of the site were readily apparent to William Sublette
and Robert Campbell, when, in 1834, they paused en route to the
annual trappers&rsquo; rendezvous to launch construction of log-stockaded
Fort William. This fort, named for Sublette, was the first fort on the
Laramie.</p>
<p>In 1835, Sublette and Campbell sold Fort William to Jim Bridger,
Thomas Fitzpatrick, and Milton Sublette, and a year later these men
in turn sold their interests to the monopolistic American Fur Co.
(after 1838, known officially as Pierre Chouteau, Jr. and Company).</p>
<p>Rev. Samuel Parker and Dr. Marcus Whitman, early missionaries
to Oregon, traveling with a company of fur traders, paused at &ldquo;the
fort of the Black Hills&rdquo; in July 1835. Reverend Parker has left a vivid
description of activities at the fort, including near-fatal fights between
drunken trappers, a council with the chiefs of 2,000 Oglala Sioux
gathered at the fort to trade, and a buffalo dance, regarding which
Parker commented, &ldquo;I cannot say I was much amused to see
how well they could imitate brute beasts, while ignorant of God
and salvation....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marcus Whitman again traveled westward in 1836 with a fur traders&rsquo;
caravan, this time accompanied by his bride and Rev. and Mrs. Henry
H. Spalding. The ladies, the first to travel the Oregon Trail, were
extended all possible hospitality at Fort William. Especially remembered
were chairs with buffalo skin bottoms, no doubt a most welcome
change from the ordeal of saddle or wagon box.</p>
<p>To an artist, A. J. Miller, who traveled with Sir William Drummond
Stewart, we are indebted for the only known pictures of Fort William.
Made during his visit to the fort in 1837, these paintings depict a
typical log stockade which Miller&rsquo;s notes describe further as being</p>
<blockquote>
<p>of a quadrangular form, with block houses at diagonal corners to sweep
the fronts in case of attack. Over the front entrance is a large blockhouse
in which is placed a cannon. The interior of the fort is about 150 feet
square, surrounded by small cabins whose roofs reach within 3 feet of
the top of the palisades against which they abut. The Indians encamp in
great numbers here 3 or 4 times a year, bringing peltries to be exchanged
for dry goods, tobacco, beads and alcohol. The Indians have a mortal
horror of the &ldquo;big gun&rdquo; which rests in the blockhouse, as they have had
experience of its prowess and witnessed the havoc produced by its loud
&ldquo;talk&rdquo;. They conceive it to be only asleep and have a wholesome dread
of its being waked up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fur traders came to be more and more dependent upon the
fort on the Laramie as a base of supplies and a refuge in time of trouble.
Similarly, early travelers and missionaries found it a most welcome
haven in the wilderness. In 1840, the famous Father de Smet paused
at this &ldquo;Fort La Ramee&rdquo; where he was favorably impressed by a
village of Cheyennes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small"><i>Fort Platte and Fort John on the Laramie</i></span></h2>
<p>Late in 1840 or early in 1841, a rival trading post appeared. This was
Fort Platte, built of adobe on the nearby banks of the North Platte
River by L. P. Lupton, a veteran of the fur trade in what is now
Colorado, but later operated by at least two other independent trading
companies.</p>
<p>Abandonment of the rendezvous system after 1840 increased the importance
of fixed trading posts. The deterioration of Fort William
prompted the American Fur Co. to replace it in 1841 with a more pretentious
adobe-walled post which cost some $10,000. Christened Fort
John, presumably after John Sarpy, a stockholder, the new fort, like
its predecessor, was popularly known as &ldquo;Fort Laramie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Competition in the declining fur trade led to open traffic in &ldquo;fire-water,&rdquo;
and the debauchery of the Indians around Forts Platte and
Laramie was noted by many travelers of the early 1840&rsquo;s. Rufus B.
Sage vividly describes the carousals of one band of Indians which
ended with the death and burial of a Brule chief. In a state of drunkenness,
this unfortunate merrymaker fell from his horse and broke his
neck while racing from Fort Laramie to Fort Platte.</p>
<p>Trade goods for the rival posts came out in wagons over the Platte
Valley road from St. Joseph or over the trail from Fort Pierre on the
upper Missouri. On the return trip, packs of buffalo robes and furs
were sent down to St. Louis. In addition to wagon transportation,
cargoes were sent by boat down the fickle Platte, which often dried
up and left the boatmen stranded on sandbars in the middle of
Nebraska.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small"><i>The First Emigrants</i></span></h2>
<p>Up to 1840, traders, adventurers, and missionaries dominated the scene.
The first party of true covered-wagon emigrants, whose experiences
were recorded by John Bidwell and Joseph Williams, paused at Fort
Laramie in 1841. The following year Lt. John C. Fremont visited
the fort on his first exploring trip to the Rocky Mountains. Recognizing
its strategic location and foreseeing the covered-wagon migrations,
Fremont added his voice to those recommending the establishment
of a military post at the site.</p>
<p>In 1843, the &ldquo;cow column,&rdquo; first of the great migrations to Oregon,
reached the fort under the guidance of Marcus Whitman. This group
numbered nearly 1,000 persons. Thereafter, the emigrants with their
covered wagons became a familiar sight each May and June. Impressions
of the swift-flowing Laramie River, the white-walled fort,
the populous Indian tepee villages, the &ldquo;squawmen&rdquo; at the fort, and
the dances held on level ground beneath nearby cottonwoods were
frequently recorded by diarists.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>More than 3,000 Oregon-bound emigrants paused at the fort in 1845,
intermingling peacefully with the numerous Sioux Indians encamped
there. Later that summer, peace still prevailed when Col. Stephen
Watts Kearny arrived with five companies of the First Dragoons,
encamped on the grassy Laramie River bottoms, and held a formal
council with the Indians between the two forts. Here the Indians
were warned against drinking &ldquo;Taos Lightning&rdquo; or disturbing the
emigrants and were assured of the love and solicitude of the Great
White Father. They were also duly impressed with his power as
symbolized in a display of howitzer fire and rockets.</p>
<p>While Fort Platte was abandoned by its owners in 1845, trade was
brisk at Fort Laramie during the winter of 1845-46, and it is recorded
that during the following spring a little fleet of Mackinaw boats,
under the leadership of the veteran factor P. D. Papin, successfully
navigated the Platte with 1,100 packs of buffalo robes, 110 packs of
beaver, and 3 packs of bear and wolf skins. Thus, it was a moderately
prosperous Fort Laramie in the waning days of the fur trade which
the young historian Francis Parkman visited in the spring of 1846
and described so vividly in his book <i>The Oregon Trail</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fort Laramie is one of the posts established by the American Fur Company,
which well-nigh monopolizes the Indian trade of this region. Prices are most
extortionate: sugar, two dollars a cup; five-cent tobacco at a dollar and a
half; bullets at seventy-five cents a pound. The company is exceedingly disliked
in this country; it suppresses all opposition and, keeping up these
enormous prices, pays its men in necessities on these terms. Here its officials
rule with an absolute sway; the arm of the United States has little force,
for when we were there the extreme outposts of her troops were about seven
hundred miles to the eastward. The little fort is built of bricks dried in the
sun, and externally is of an oblong form, with bastions of clay in the form
of ordinary blockhouses at two of the corners. The walls are about fifteen
feet high, and surmounted by a slender palisade. The roofs of the apartments
within, which are built close against the walls, serve the purpose of
banquette. Within, the fort is divided by a partition: on one side is the
square area, surrounded by the storerooms, offices, and apartments of the
inmates; on the other is the corral, a narrow place encompassed by the high
clay walls, where at night or in the presence of dangerous Indians the
horses and mules of the fort are crowded for safekeeping. The main entrance
has two gates with an arched passage intervening. A little square window,
high above the ground, opens laterally from an adjoining chamber into this
passage; so that, when the inner gate is closed and barred, a person without
may still hold communication with those within through this narrow
aperture. This obviates the necessity of admitting suspicious Indians for
purposes of trading into the body of the fort, for when danger is apprehended
the inner gate is shut fast, and all traffic is carried on by means of
the window. This precaution, though necessary at some of the company&rsquo;s
posts, is seldom resorted to at Fort Laramie, where, though men are frequently
killed in the neighborhood, no apprehensions are felt of any general
designs of hostility from the Indians.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>While here, Parkman also witnessed the arrival of the Donner party,
who paused at the fort to celebrate the Fourth of July. Many of this
party later met a tragic fate in the snow-locked passes of the Sierras.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small"><i>The Mormon Migrations, 1847-48</i></span></h2>
<p>While many of the early visitors to Fort Laramie were missionaries,
mass emigration motivated by religion was not in evidence until 1847.
That spring the pioneer band of Mormons, led by Brigham Young,
passed up the north bank of the Platte to its confluence with the Laramie,
and crossed near the ruins of Fort Platte. They paused there for a
few days to repair wagons and record for future emigrants the facilities
available at Fort Laramie, of which James Bordeaux was then in charge.
This party of 143 men, 3 women, and 2 children seeking a new Zion in
the Salt Lake Valley were but pathbreakers for more than 4,000
Mormons who almost monopolized the trail in 1848.</p>
<p>Like emigrants of all sects, the Mormons enjoyed a respite from
travel on arrival at the great way station of Fort Laramie. A variety of
activities engaged the emigrants during their brief stopover. Men
engaged in blacksmithing and general repair, traded at the fort, or
went fishing. The women busied themselves with washing and baking
or gathered chokecherries or currants.</p>
<p>The Mormons at this time conceived a plan which was used for
several years at Fort Laramie. Wagon supply trains from Utah, drawn
by teams acclimated to mountain travel, met emigrating &ldquo;Saints&rdquo; from
the East, and teams were exchanged. Thus, they avoided the serious
losses of stock often resulting when tired low-country teams encountered
the high altitudes of South Pass and the rough mountain trails
into Utah.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, despite a moderately brisk business with the emigrants,
trading at Fort Laramie continued to suffer from the general decline
of the fur market and the competition of independent dealers in &ldquo;Taos
Lightning.&rdquo; Conditions were now ripe for the early retirement of the
American Fur Co.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small"><i>Fort Laramie Becomes a Military Post</i></span></h2>
<p>For some years the Government had considered establishing military
posts along the Oregon Trail for the protection of emigrants, and this
site at the mouth of the Laramie had often been recommended. In
December 1845, such action was proposed by President Polk and in
May 1846 the Congress approved &ldquo;An Act to provide for raising a
regiment of Mounted Riflemen, and for establishing military stations
on the route to Oregon.&rdquo; Funds were provided to mount and equip
the troops, to defray the expenses of each station, and to compensate
the Indian tribes on whose lands these stations might be erected.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>The Mexican War delayed the projected building of forts on the
Oregon Trail, but in 1847 a battalion of Missouri Mounted Volunteers
was recruited. Early in 1848 this battalion established Fort Kearny,
the first of the posts on the trail, on the south bank of the Platte near
the head of Grand Island. In November, they were mustered out,
being relieved by the Mounted Riflemen.</p>
<p>During the following winter the news of the discovery of gold in
California was published throughout the land, and the resulting
fevered preparations to trek westward the next spring increased the
urgency of completing the chain of forts.</p>
<p>In March, United States Adj. Gen. Roger Jones directed Gen. D. E.
Triggs at St. Louis to carry out establishment of the second post &ldquo;at
or near Fort Laramie, a trading station belonging to the American
Fur Company.&rdquo; Lt. Daniel P. Woodbury, of the Corps of Engineers,
was authorized to purchase the buildings of Fort Laramie &ldquo;should he
deem it necessary to do so.&rdquo; Companies A and E, Mounted Riflemen,
and Company G, Sixth Infantry, were designated as the first garrison
of the new post with Maj. W. F. Sanderson, Mounted Riflemen, in
command.</p>
<p>Major Sanderson with 4 officers and 58 men of Company E, Mounted
Riflemen, left Fort Leavenworth early in May and arrived at the
Laramie on June 16 without incident. On June 27 he wrote to the
adjutant general reporting that after making a thorough reconnaissance
of the neighborhood he had found this to be the most eligible
site and that at his request Lieutenant Woodbury had, on June 26,
purchased Fort Laramie from Bruce Husband, agent of the American
Fur Co., for $4,000. He reported further that good pine timber, limestone,
hay, and dry wood were readily available and that the Laramie
River furnished abundant good water for the command.</p>
<p>Company C, Mounted Rifles, consisting of 2 officers and 60 men,
arrived at the post on July 26, and on August 12 the 2 officers and 53
men of Company G, Sixth Infantry, completed the garrison and joined
in the work of preparing additional quarters.</p>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small"><i>The California Gold Rush</i></span></h2>
<p>Meanwhile, these troops had been preceded, accompanied, and followed
over the trail by some 30,000 goldseekers bound for California,
a few thousand Mormons en route to Utah, and additional troops of
Mounted Riflemen pushing west to establish a post at Fort Hall in
Idaho.</p>
<p>Many of those who trekked westward from the Missouri did not even
reach Fort Laramie. The dread Asiatic cholera took a terrible toll
along the banks of the Platte. Fresh graves, averaging one and a half
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
to the mile, marked the 700-mile trail from Westport Landing to the
Laramie. Beyond Fort Laramie the ravages of disease abated, but
already many trains were short of men and stock. These conditions
and the rougher roads ahead frequently forced the abandonment of
wagons, personal property, and stocks of provisions. However, not all
of the westward surging throng reached Fort Laramie with surplus
supplies. Many were thankful to be able to replenish dwindling supplies
at the commissary as well as to obtain fresh draft animals, repair
failing wagons, and mail letters to &ldquo;the States.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig3">

<p class="pcap"><i>Fort Laramie in 1849.</i> From <i>An Expedition to the Valley of the
Great Salt Lake of Utah</i> by Howard Stansbury.</p>
</div>
<p>While purchase of the adobe trading post provided the Army with a
measure of shelter for men and supplies, it was far from adequate. In
late June 1849, Major Sanderson reported that the entire command was
already employed in cutting and hauling timber and burning lime.
Stone was also quarried and a horse-powered sawmill placed in operation.
By winter, a two-storied block of officers&rsquo; quarters (to become
known as &ldquo;Old Bedlam&rdquo;), a block of soldiers&rsquo; quarters, a bakery, and
two stables had been pushed near enough completion to be occupied.</p>
<p>That winter was mild and uneventful at Fort Laramie, but by early
May 1850 the high tide of westward migration began. Goldseekers and
homeseekers bound for California, Oregon, or Utah thronged the trails
on both sides of the Platte and converged on the fort, where, by August
14, a record had been made of 39,506 men, 2,421 women, 2,609 children,
9,927 wagons, and proportionate numbers of livestock. Also, 316 deaths
en route were recorded, for cholera again raged along the trail in
Nebraska. The graves along the trail east of Fort Laramie were only
outnumbered by the bodies of dead draft animals and piles of abandoned
property westward toward South Pass.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>Meager blacksmithing and repair facilities were available to the
emigrants at Fort Laramie. Supplies could be purchased at the commissary
and at the sutler&rsquo;s store, whose adobe walls were first noted
that year. The sutler, John S. Tutt, also had brisk competition from
numerous oldtime mountain men who set up shop along the trails
nearby.</p>
<p>The post commander reported further progress in new construction
during 1850. The stonewalled magazine was probably completed that
year, &ldquo;Old Bedlam&rdquo; neared completion, and a two-storied barracks
was begun. Lured by gold, however, troops as well as civilian artisans
deserted the post to such an extent that Mexican labor was imported
for building and experimental farming.</p>
<p>In 1851, the gold fever subsided somewhat, but Mormon emigrations
increased and in all probability 20,000 emigrants trekked westward
past the fort. Cholera was not epidemic and emigration was less eventful,
but the fort was busy preparing to play host to other visitors.</p>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small"><i>The Fort Laramie Treaty Council, 1851</i></span></h2>
<p>Early in 1851, the Congress had authorized holding a great treaty
council with the Plains Indians to assure peaceful relations along the
trails to the West. D. D. Mitchell and Thomas Fitzpatrick, the commissioners,
chose Fort Laramie as the meeting place and summoned
the various Indian tribes to come in by September 1. For days before
that date, Indians gathered at the fort. The Sioux, Cheyennes, and
Arapahoes mingled freely, but tension mounted as their enemies, the
Snakes and Crows, made their appearance. Peace prevailed, however,
and the sole major difficulties were a grazing problem and the late
arrival of a wagon train of gifts. The countless ponies accompanying
10,000 Indians required so much forage that the vast assemblage had
to move to the meadows at the mouth of Horse Creek, 30 miles east of
the fort. Chiefs representing many other tribes arrived. Parades of
Indian hordes in full array were held, speeches made, presents distributed,
the pipe of peace smoked, and by September 17 it had been
agreed that peace should reign among the red men and between them
and the whites. The white men were to be free to travel the roads and
hold their scattered forts, and the Indians were to receive an annuity
of $50,000 in goods each year. The council was considered a great
success and gave promise of a lasting peace on the plains.</p>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small"><i>The Emigrant Tide and Indian Troubles, 1852-53</i></span></h2>
<p>In 1852, the emigrant tide again swelled to nearly 40,000, over 10,000 of
which were Mormons. The emigrants were encouraged to depend
on supplies available at Fort Laramie and other posts along
the trail. A toll bridge over the Laramie River, a mile below the fort,
eliminated one obstacle on the trail, and disease took a much lighter
toll of lives.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>Beginning in 1850, many of the emigrants on the north bank, or
Mormon Trail, stopped crossing to the south bank trail at Fort Laramie
and followed a rough, but shorter, route westward along the north
side of the river. Those who did not cross with their wagons, however,
still found the old ferry across the North Platte a welcome means of
visiting the fort for mail and supplies. In 1853, this ferry figured in the
first serious Indian trouble near the fort.</p>
<p>The Sioux were becoming alarmed by the great numbers of whites
using the Oregon Trail, with resulting destruction of game, and the ravages
of new diseases among the tribes. On June 15, a group of Sioux
seized the ferry boat, and one of them fired on Sergeant Raymond,
who recaptured it. Lt. H. B. Fleming and 23 men were dispatched to
the Indian village to arrest the offender. The Indians refused to give
up the culprit and fired on the soldiers. In the resulting skirmish, 3
Indians were killed, 3 wounded, and 2 taken prisoner. The Miniconjou
Sioux were incensed by this action, but after a full explanation by
Capt. R. Garnett, commander of the fort, they accepted their annuities
from the Indian agent and no further hostilities resulted that year.</p>
<p>In spite of this incident and considerable begging and thievery by
Indians, the emigrants had been in little real danger of Indian attack.
All this was changed by an unfortunate occurrence late in the summer
of 1854.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">

</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small"><i>The Grattan and Harney Massacres, 1854-55</i></span></h2>
<p>Until August 18, summer emigration in 1854 appears to have been
unaffected by trouble with the Indians. On that day a Mormon caravan
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
passed a village of Brule Sioux 8 miles east of Fort Laramie, and
a cow ran into the village where it was appropriated by a visiting
Miniconjou brave. This matter was reported at the fort by both the
Mormons and the chief of the Brules. Lt. John Grattan, Sixth Infantry,
with 29 soldiers, 2 cannon, and an interpreter, was dispatched to the
village to arrest the offending Indian. Unfortunately, the interpreter
was drunk and the young officer was arrogant. The Indian offender
refused to give himself up and a fight was precipitated in the Indian
village, resulting in the annihilation of the military party.</p>
<p>The enraged Indians then pillaged Bordeaux&rsquo;s nearby trading post
and helped themselves to both annuity goods and company property
at the American Fur Co.&rsquo;s post 3 miles up the river. Fortunately, no
attack was made on the small remaining garrison of Fort Laramie to
which neighboring traders and others rushed for protection. All Sioux
immediately left the vicinity of the fort, and the Cheyennes and Arapahoes
waited only for the distribution of treaty goods before moving
away.</p>
<p>During the following year, Indians committed many small-scale
depredations along the Oregon Trail. However, despite greatly
exaggerated alarms, the emigrants of 1855 were for the most part
unmolested. Meanwhile, the Army had become convinced that the
Indians must be punished, and a force of 600 men under Gen. W. S.
Harney marched westward from Fort Leavenworth. The Indian agent
at Fort Laramie warned all friendly Indians to come to the south side
of the Platte&mdash;a warning heeded by many bands. On September 2,
General Harney arrived at Ash Hollow, 150 miles below Fort Laramie,
and located Little Thunder&rsquo;s band of Brule Sioux some 6 miles north
on the Blue Water. Early the next morning, after rejecting protestations
of friendship by Little Thunder, his troops attacked the village
from two sides, killing 86 Indians and capturing an almost equal
number of women and children. At Fort Laramie, General Harney
issued a stern warning to other Sioux bands, then proceeded overland
through Sioux territory to establish a military post at Fort Pierre on
the upper Missouri River.</p>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small"><i>Handcart to Pony Express, 1856-61</i></span></h2>
<p>In 1856, in an effort to reduce the cost of emigration to Utah, the
Mormons introduced the handcart plan. Two-wheeled handcarts,
similar to those once used by street sweepers, were constructed of
Iowa hickory and oak. One cart was assigned to each four or five
converts who walked and pushed or pulled their carts over the long
trek from the railhead at Iowa City to the Salt Lake Valley. Livestock
was driven with the parties and at times 1 ox-drawn wagon to each
100 emigrants was provided to carry additional baggage and supplies.
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
The first handcart parties were very successful, but the last two, in 1856,
started too late in the summer and were snowed in near Devil&rsquo;s Gate.
There, more than 200 of the 1,000 or more in the two parties perished
from cold and hunger before the survivors could be rescued by wagon
trains sent out from Utah. From 1856 to 1860 some 3,000 Mormons
made the journey to Utah in 10 handcart companies, and to these
footsore travelers Fort Laramie was indeed a haven in the wilderness.</p>
<p>Early in 1857, the War Department decided to abandon Fort
Laramie, but events forced the cancellation of the order before it could
be carried out, and the fort again demonstrated its strategic importance.
First, it served as a supply base for a punitive expedition led by Col.
E. V. Sumner against the Cheyennes between the Platte and Arkansas
Rivers. Then, as that campaign drew to an inconclusive end, the fort
became a vital base for the Army which marched toward Utah that
fall to subdue the reportedly rebellious Mormons.</p>
<p>By the next year, the Utah Campaign involved some 6,000 troops,
half of whom were in or near Utah, with Fort Laramie their nearest
sure source of supply.</p>
<p>In spite of this warlike activity, thousands of emigrants continued
to roll westward by covered wagon, the great travel medium of the
plains. To these the fort was a vital way station, as it was to the great
firm of Russell, Majors, and Waddell, freighting contractors who
carried supplies to the Army in Utah. In 1858, this enterprise alone
involved 3,500 wagons, 40,000 oxen, 1,000 mules, and 4,000 men.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1850, mail service of varying frequency and reliability
linked Fort Laramie with the States to the east and Salt Lake City to
the west. Interrupted in the summer of 1857 by the Utah Campaign, a
new and improved weekly mail service was organized in 1858 bringing
news only 12 days old from the Missouri River to the fort.</p>
<p>In 1858, the discovery of gold at Cherry Creek, 200 miles south of
Fort Laramie, precipitated the Colorado gold rush. That winter Fort
Laramie was the nearest link between the gold miners clustered about
the site of Denver, Colo., and the outside world. An informal mail
express to the fort was organized and carried by old trappers.</p>
<p>These developments were soon overshadowed by the spectacular
pony express. The first westbound rider galloped into Fort Laramie on
April 6, 1860, just 3 days out from St. Joseph, Mo. This remarkable
system of relays of riders and ponies carried up to 10 pounds of mail
from St. Joseph to San Francisco in 13 days, at the rate of $5 in gold for
a half-ounce letter. Later, a Government subsidy, begun on July 1, 1861,
reduced the rate to $1 for one-half ounce. On that same date daily
overland mail coaches began operating from St. Joseph to San Francisco,
via Fort Laramie, on an 18-day schedule.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the poles and wires of the first transcontinental telegraph
were stretching out across the plains and mountains. Reaching
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
Fort Laramie in September, the telegraph was completed to Salt Lake
City and connected with the line from the west coast on October 24,
1861. That date also marked the end of the pony express which,
although a financial failure that cost W. H. Russell his fortune, had
proved the practicability of the central route to California for year-round
travel.</p>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small"><i>The Civil War and the Uprising of the Plains Indians</i></span></h2>
<p>The outbreak of the Civil War led to the reduction of garrisons at all
outposts. This, coupled with a bloody uprising of the Sioux in Minnesota
in 1862, inspired the Plains Indians, nursing many grievances, to
go on the warpath. In the spring of 1862, many stage stations along the
Platte route were raided and burned. To meet this threat, volunteer
cavalry from Utah rushed east to the South Pass area, and the Eleventh
Ohio Volunteer Cavalry under Col. Wm. O. Collins was ordered west
to Fort Laramie. These raids also prompted the moving of the overland
mail and stage route south to the Overland Trail and the establishment
of Fort Halleck 120 miles to the southwest. During this period, troops
at Fort Laramie continued to protect the vital telegraph line through
South Pass and a still considerable volume of travelers, principally to
Utah.</p>
<p>The next winter was fairly peaceful at Fort Laramie, and of social
life at the post young Caspar Collins wrote to his mother: &ldquo;They make
the soldiers wear white gloves at this post, and they cut around very
fashionably. A good many of the regulars are married and have their
wives and families with them.&rdquo; He also indicated that they had a circulating
library, a band, amateur theatricals, and an occasional ball.
However, the dangers of the frontier were ever present, and, later
that winter, troops en route from Fort Laramie to Fort Halleck encountered
weather so severe that several were frozen to death.</p>
<p>Indians continued to steal horses from the overland mail stations,
freighters, and ranchers, and incidents provoked by both whites and
Indians piled up until the whole region was in a state of alarm.
Efforts were made to call the Indians into the forts to treat for peace,
but with little success.</p>
<p>At this time the difficulty of detecting the movements of Indian war
parties was demonstrated at Fort Laramie. Returning from a 3-day
scout, without finding a sign of hostile Indians, a large detachment of
troops unsaddled their horses and let them roll on the parade grounds.
Suddenly, at midday, a daring party of 30 warriors dashed through
the fort, drove the horses off to the north and escaped, with all but
the poorest animals, despite a 48-hour pursuit. The fort&rsquo;s commander,
Major Wood, was described by his adjutant as &ldquo;the maddest man I
ever saw.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>Later in 1864, after another attempt to make peace with the northern
Indians had failed, Gen. R. B. Mitchell ordered the strengthening of
the defenses along the road to South Pass. Several former stage and
pony express stations were strengthened and garrisoned. Fort Sedgwick,
near Julesburg, and Fort Mitchell, at Scottsbluff, were among
those established. Fort Laramie became headquarters of a district
extending from South Pass east to Mud Springs Station. Meanwhile,
Indian raids along the South Platte River virtually cut off Denver from
the east for 6 weeks.</p>
<p>Continuing efforts to seek peace with the Indians were made unsuccessful
by the Sand Creek Massacre in November 1864, which united
the southern bands of Sioux, Cheyenne, and Arapahoe on the warpath.
Early in January 1865, they raided Julesburg, sacking the station,
carrying off great quantities of foodstuffs, and almost succeeding in
destroying the garrison of Fort Sedgwick. Efforts to burn out the Indians
by setting a 300-mile-wide prairie fire brought them swarming
back to the attack, destroying the South Platte road stations and miles
of telegraph line, sacking and burning Julesburg a second time, and
driving off great herds of livestock. While troops from Fort Laramie
arrived at Mud Springs Station in time to fight off the Indians there,
all efforts by troops from Fort Laramie and the east failed to prevent
the Indians from escaping with their booty across the North Platte,
near Ash Hollow.</p>
<p>Termination of the Civil War in April 1865 released many troops for
service against the Indians, and plans were laid for extensive punitive
expeditions, especially in the country to the north of the North Platte
River.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>In May, the fort&rsquo;s commander, Col. Thomas Moonlight, led 500
cavalrymen on a 450-mile foray into the Wind River Valley, but failed
to find the Indians. Meanwhile, there were several raids on stations
westward to South Pass. An effort to move a village of friendly Brules
from Fort Laramie to Fort Kearny resulted in a fight at Horse Creek
where Captain Fouts and four soldiers were killed as these Indians
escaped to join the hostiles. In pursuing them, all of Colonel Moonlight&rsquo;s
horses were stolen, and he returned to Fort Laramie in disgrace.</p>
<p>The major Indian raids of the summer centered on Platte Bridge
Station, 130 miles above Fort Laramie, where late in July a large force
of Indians wiped out a wagon train and killed 26 white men, including
Lt. Caspar Collins who led a small party from the station in a valiant
rescue effort.</p>

</div>
<p>In the meantime, a great campaign against the Indians, known as
the Powder River Expedition, got under way with 2,500 men, directed
by Gen. R. E. Connor. Of three columns planned to converge on the
Indians in the Powder River country, the first, under Colonel Cole,
started from Omaha, marched up the Loup River Valley, thence east
of the Black Hills and on to the Powder River in Montana. The second,
under Lieutenant Colonel Walker, left Fort Laramie, marched north
along the west side of the Black Hills, and joined Colonel Cole&rsquo;s column
as planned. The third, under General Connor, marched about 100
miles up the Platte from Fort Laramie, then north to the headwaters
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
of Powder River where a small fort, Camp Connor, was established;
thence, down the Powder River, where he destroyed the village and
supplies of a large band of Arapahoes, but failed to meet the other two
columns. The other commanders, lacking adequate supplies and proper
knowledge of the country, lost most of their horses and mules in a
September storm and, beset by fast-riding Indians, were forced to
destroy the bulk of their heavy equipment. They were finally found
and led to Camp Connor just in time to prevent heavy losses by starvation
and possible destruction by Indians. The expedition straggled
back to Fort Laramie, a failure.</p>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small"><i>Peace Talk and War on the Bozeman Trail, 1866-68</i></span></h2>
<p>Officials at Washington now decided to try peaceful measures with the
Indians of the Fort Laramie region, and General Connor was succeeded
in command by General Wheaton. Emissaries were sent to
the tribes, inviting them to a general peace council at Fort Laramie
in June 1866.</p>
<p>In March of that year, Col. Henry Maynadier, then in command at
Fort Laramie, reported, as auguring success of the peace council, that
Spotted Tail, head chief of the Brule Sioux, had brought in the body
of his daughter for burial among the whites at Fort Laramie. Her
name was Ah-ho-ap-pa, which is Sioux for wheat flour, although
modern poets have referred to her as Fallen Leaf. In the summer of
1864, she was a familiar figure at Fort Laramie. While she haughtily
refused the crackers, coffee, and bacon doled out to the Indian women
and children at that time, she spent long hours on a bench by the
sutler&rsquo;s store watching the white man&rsquo;s way of life. She was particularly
fond of watching the guard mount and the dress parade, and the
officer in charge was often especially decked out in sash and plumes
for her benefit. She refused to marry one of her own people, attempted
to learn English, and told her people they were fools for not living
in houses and making peace with the whites. When the Sioux went
on the warpath in 1864, however, Spotted Tail and his daughter were
with them and spent the next year in the Powder River country. There
the hard life weakened her, and she sickened and died during the
following cold winter.</p>
<p>Having promised to carry out her express wish to be buried at Fort
Laramie, her father led the funeral procession on a journey of 260
miles. Colonel Maynadier responded gallantly to Spotted Tail&rsquo;s request.
In a ceremony which combined all the pageantry of the military and
the primitive tradition of the Sioux, her body was placed in a coffin
on a raised platform a half mile north of the parade grounds. Thus,
a long step had been taken toward winning the friendship of a great
chief.</p>

</div>
<p>By June, a good representation of Brule and Oglala Sioux being
present, the commissioners set about negotiating a treaty. In the meantime,
unfortunately, the War Department sent out an expedition
instructed to open the Bozeman Trail through the Powder River
country to the Montana gold mines. Colonel Carrington and his troops
arrived at Fort Laramie in the midst of the negotiations and caused
serious unrest among the Indians. One chief commented, &ldquo;Great
Father send us presents and wants new road, but white chief goes with
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
soldiers to steal road before Indian say yes or no,&rdquo; and a large faction,
led by Red Cloud and Man-Afraid-of-His-Horses, withdrew in open
opposition to all peace talk. Nevertheless, the remaining Indians agreed
to a treaty which provided for the opening of the Bozeman Trail.</p>
<p>In late June the troops under Colonel Carrington marched up the
trail, garrisoned Camp Connor (later moved and named Fort Reno),
and began building Fort Phil Kearny at the foot of the Bighorn Mountains
and Fort C. F. Smith farther north in Montana. Immediately,
it became evident that the peace treaty was meaningless. Fort
Phil Kearny was the scene of almost daily Indian attacks on traders,
wagon trains, wood-cutting parties, and troops. These attacks were
climaxed on December 21 when Capt. William Fetterman and 80
men were led into an ambush and annihilated by Indians led by Crazy
Horse and Red Cloud. The fort and its remaining garrison were in
danger of being overwhelmed, and the nearest aid lay at Fort Laramie,
236 miles away. At midnight, John &ldquo;Portugee&rdquo; Phillips, trader and
scout, slipped out into a blizzard on the colonel&rsquo;s favorite horse and
in 4 days made his way across the storm-swept, Indian-infested plains
to Fort Laramie in one of the truly heroic rides of American history.
While his gallant mount lay dying on the parade ground, Phillips
interrupted a gay Christmas night party in &ldquo;Old Bedlam&rdquo; to deliver
his message, and a relief expedition was soon on its way.</p>
<p>The severe weather made an attempted winter campaign against
the Indians unsuccessful, and there was no important fighting until
summer. On August 2, 1867, the Indians again attacked a woodcutting
party near Fort Phil Kearny, but the small detachment led by Captain
Powell was armed with the new 1866 Springfield breech-loading rifles
and fought off repeated charges by the Indians in the famous Wagon
Box Fight.</p>

<h2 id="c14"><span class="small"><i>The Treaty of 1868</i></span></h2>
<p>Again, the peace advocates in Washington were in the ascendancy, and
in the summer of 1867 the Congress provided a commission to treat
with the Indians, but authorized recruiting an army of 4,000 men if
peace was not attained. Treaties with the southern tribes were concluded
at Fort Larned in October, and the commissioners came to
Fort Laramie in November to treat with the northern tribes. However,
few came in and the hostiles, led by Red Cloud, sent word that no
treaty was possible until the forts on the Bozeman Trail and in the
valley of the Powder River were abandoned to the Indians. They did
agree to cease hostilities and to come to Fort Laramie the next
spring. In April 1868, the commissioners came again to Fort Laramie
and were prepared to grant the Indians&rsquo; demands, including abandonment
of the Bozeman Trail. By late May, both the Brule and Oglala
Sioux had signed the treaty, but Red Cloud refused to sign until the
troops had left the Powder River country and his warriors had burned
the abandoned Fort Phil Kearny to the ground.</p>

<p>This treaty gave the Indians all of what is now South Dakota west of
the Missouri River as a reservation. It also gave them control and hunting
rights in the great territory north of the North Platte River and
east of the Bighorn Mountains as unceded Indian lands. The Indian
agencies were to be built on the Missouri River. Many of the Indians,
however, objected to giving up trading at Fort Laramie as had been
their custom, and, in 1870, a temporary agency for Red Cloud&rsquo;s band
was established on the North Platte River 30 miles below the fort, at
the present Nebraska-Wyoming line. Finally, in 1873, after he and
other chiefs had twice been taken to Washington and New York to
view the numbers and power of the white man, Red Cloud agreed to
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
having his agency moved north to a site on White River away from
Fort Laramie and the Platte Road.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig14">

<p>In the meantime, peace prevailed on the high plains, and, in 1872,
it was reported that not a white man was killed in the department of
the Platte.</p>
<p>Later in 1873, however, the attitude of many Indians toward their
agents at the Red Cloud and Spotted Tail agencies became so hostile
that the agents requested that troops be stationed at the agencies.
Although the Indians protested this as a violation of their treaty rights,
Camp Robinson and Camp Sheridan were established at these respective
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
agencies in 1874. At the same time, funds were obtained for an
iron bridge over the North Platte at Fort Laramie. Its completion, early
in 1876, gave the troops there ready access to the Indian country.</p>

</div>
<p>Rumors of gold in the Black Hills of South Dakota had persisted for
many years, which induced the Government to send an expedition
under Col. George A. Custer from Fort Abraham Lincoln on the upper
Missouri to investigate the area. Proceeding without opposition from
the Indians, the expedition confirmed the presence of gold in the hills
and sent out word of their discoveries to Fort Laramie in August 1874.
The resulting rush of prospecting parties was at first forbidden by the
military, who rounded up several and imprisoned some of their leaders
at Fort Laramie, while other parties were attacked by the Indians for
flagrant violation of the treaty of 1868.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>A second expedition, led by Col. R. I. Dodge and Prof. W. P. Jenney,
set out from Fort Laramie the next spring to explore and evaluate the
gold deposits in the Black Hills. Miners also thronged the hills, and
efforts to make them await negotiations with the Indians were only
partly successful. Meanwhile, the Government did make an effort to
buy the Black Hills from the Sioux; but the Indians, led by Chief
Spotted Tail, set a justly high price on the area, which the Government
refused to meet. Moreover, the wild bands of Sitting Bull and other
chiefs refused to sell at any price and warned the whites to stay out.
No longer restrained by the Army, the miners now swarmed into the
hills, which became a powder keg.</p>
<p>Ignoring existing treaties, the Government decided to force the wild
Sioux onto their reservation, and when the order for them to come
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
in was not instantly complied with, the Army prepared for action.
A double enveloping campaign was planned, to be led by Gen. George
Crook with troops based at Fort Laramie and Fort Fetterman, and
by Gen. Alfred H. Terry with Custer&rsquo;s Seventh Cavalry from Fort
Abraham Lincoln and Col. John Gibbon&rsquo;s command from Fort Ellis,
Mont. In March, Crook marched north from Fort Fetterman, 80
miles northwest of Fort Laramie, with 12 companies of soldiers. His
cavalry surprised a large village of Sioux and Cheyenne on the Little
Powder River in Montana, but Crazy Horse rallied the Indians and
forced the troops to retreat. Again in late May, Crook moved north
with 20 companies of men plus 300 friendly Shoshones and Crows,
and once more, on June 17, on the Rosebud, he was defeated by a
great array of warriors led by Crazy Horse. Retreating to his supply
camp, Crook again decided to send for reinforcements.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, General Terry&rsquo;s command had marched west from Fort
Abraham Lincoln and met Colonel Gibbon&rsquo;s detachment on the
Yellowstone River. Again dividing his forces, Terry sent Custer and
the entire Seventh Cavalry up the Rosebud River, while he and Gibbon,
with 12 companies of infantry and four troops of cavalry, proceeded
up the Bighorn River.</p>
<p>On the morning of June 25, 1876, Custer&rsquo;s scouts sighted the Indian
village in the valley of the Little Bighorn. He divided his command to
attack the village from three directions. The Indians, however, first
met Maj. Marcus A. Reno&rsquo;s contingent of three troops in the afternoon
in overwhelming numbers and forced them to retreat to a defensive
position, where they were joined by a similar detachment under Capt.
Frederick W. Benteen and the pack train. Meanwhile, the great part
of the Indians had swung away to meet and wipe out Custer&rsquo;s personal
command of five troops. Again the warriors attacked Reno, but since
he was on favorable ground he was able to fight them off until the next
day when their scouts detected the approach of General Terry. Firing
the grass, the Indians moved off into the Bighorn Mountain, leaving
over 260 soldiers dead on the battlefield. It was an empty victory, however,
as the Indians were compelled to scatter to hunt for food. By
winter, reinforced armies under General Crook and Colonel Miles had
defeated bands led by Dull Knife and Crazy Horse, forcing them to
return to the reservation and surrender, while Sitting Bull&rsquo;s band fled
north into Canada.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Government had decreed that no annuities
should be paid to the hostile bands or to any Sioux until they had
ceded the coveted Black Hills to the whites. A commission succeeded
in getting the Sioux to sign an agreement effecting that end when it
became law in February 1877.</p>
<p>The Northern Cheyennes were taken south to the Indian territory
in 1877, but they broke away the next year, led by Dull Knife and
Little Wolf, and headed north for their old home in the Dakotas.
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
After hard campaigning by troops from Fort Laramie and other posts,
many of Dull Knife&rsquo;s band were killed and all others were captured.
These, however, were permitted to remain on the northern
reservation.</p>

</div>
<p>The rush to the Black Hills gave new importance to Fort Laramie,
for, with its bridge across the North Platte, it was the gateway to
the gold-mining region via the trail leading north from Cheyenne,
whose merchants advertised the route as being well guarded. Although
the troops from the fort were virtually all engaged in the effort to
combat Indian depredations and provide escorts, travel to the gold
fields was in fact extremely hazardous. Regular service by the Cheyenne
and Black Hills stage line was impossible, until conditions improved
in the fall of 1876. But no sooner had Indian raids on the trail lessened
than the activities of &ldquo;road agents&rdquo; threatened the traveler. Even
armored coaches with shotgun guards failed to deter the bandits
seeking gold shipments.</p>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small"><i>Last Years of the Army Post, 1877-90</i></span></h2>
<p>Beginning in the late 1870&rsquo;s, other changes took place around Fort
Laramie. With the Indians removed to reservations, ranchers and other
settlers came in, and great herds of cattle replaced the buffalo on the
Wyoming plains. To many of these settlers the fort on the Laramie
was a supply center, as well as insurance against Indian outbreaks and
lawless white men.</p>

<p>During these same years, Fort Laramie was assuming a false air of
permanence as many of the old buildings of frame, log, and adobe
construction were replaced by sturdy new structures with lime-concrete
walls. A water system changed the parade ground from a gravelly
flat to a tree-shaded greensward. The last cavalry unit to be stationed
at the fort rode away in 1883 with Col. Wesley Merritt. Part of the
Seventh Infantry, commanded by Colonel Gibbon, then garrisoned
the post.</p>

</div>
<p>Fort Laramie&rsquo;s importance had been threatened by construction of
the Union Pacific Railroad 100 miles to the south. Its fate was now
sealed by construction, in the late 1880&rsquo;s, of the Northwestern Line
50 miles to the north. This made Fort Robinson the logical guardian
of the Indian reservations to the north, and by 1886 Col. Henry Merriam,
then commanding officer of the Seventh Infantry and Fort Laramie,
was ready to agree that further development of the old post was
unwise. Not until August 31, 1889, however, was abandonment of the
proud old fort decreed. At the request of Wyoming&rsquo;s Governor Warren,
troops remained at the post until March 2, 1890, when the last
two companies of the Seventh Infantry marched away. A few men
were left to ship movable property, while a detachment from Fort
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
Robinson dismantled some of the structures and on April 9, 1890,
auctioned off the buildings and fixtures. At that auction, Lt. C. M.
Taylor of the Ninth Cavalry sold the buildings of historic Fort Laramie
at prices ranging from $2.50 to $100. Thirty-five lots of buildings and
much miscellaneous furniture and fixtures brought a total of $1,395.</p>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small"><i>The Homesteaders Take Over</i></span></h2>
<p>In June 1890, the military reservation of some 35,000 acres was turned
over to the Department of the Interior and opened to homesteading.
John Hunton was appointed custodian of the abandoned military
reservation for the General Land Office. He first came to Fort Laramie
in 1867 to work for the sutler. Later, he became a ranch operator, and
in 1888 he succeeded John London as post trader. Hunton was a major
buyer at the final auction and managed to homestead the northwest
side of the old parade grounds of the fort, continuing to operate the
sutler&rsquo;s store briefly, and living next door in the former officers&rsquo; quarters
for nearly 30 years.</p>
<p>Another of the major purchasers at the auction was one Joe Wilde,
who also homesteaded part of the fort grounds, including the commissary
storehouse and the cavalry barracks. He converted the buildings
into a combination hotel, dance hall, and saloon and operated them as
a social center for North Platte Valley residents for over 25 years. The
west end of the parade grounds and the site of the old adobe trading
post which the Army had demolished in 1862 was homesteaded by the
widow of Thomas Sandercock, a civilian engineer at the fort, who
made her home in the officers&rsquo; quarters which had been built in 1870.</p>
<p>A dozen or more buildings used by these civilian owners were preserved
with some alterations; but the bulk of the buildings were soon
dismantled for lumber by their purchasers, and the old fort became
a part of many a ranch home, homestead shack, or barn.</p>

<h2 id="c18"><span class="small"><i>Efforts to Preserve the Fort</i></span></h2>
<p>John Hunton and a few other citizens recognized the historic importance
of the old fort and expressed regret at its decay. In 1913,
despairing anything better, they erected a monument commemorating
its long service as a military post on the Oregon Trail.</p>
<p>Lands and buildings changed hands. Absentee landlords, tenants,
and souvenir hunters contributed much to the destruction of the
historic buildings and to the scattering of priceless relics. Creation
of the Wyoming Historical Landmark Commission in 1927 initiated
efforts to achieve public ownership and to protect this historic site.
Ten years later the State of Wyoming appropriated funds for the purchase
and donation to the Federal Government of 214 acres of land,
including the surviving buildings. By Presidential proclamation, this
became Fort Laramie National Monument on July 16, 1938, under the
administration of the National Park Service of the United States
Department of the Interior.</p>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small"><i>Guide to the Area</i></span></h2>
<p>At Fort Laramie, the National Park Service is endeavoring to preserve
the surviving features of the military period and, after exhaustive
research, to restore standing buildings and related portions of the
grounds to their appearance around 1888. Certain of the older structures
provide glimpses of the fort scene as early as 1849.</p>
<p>The numbers in the following guide section correspond to numbers
on the guide map.</p>
<h3>1. CAVALRY BARRACKS&mdash;INFORMATION CENTER.</h3>
<p>It is suggested that you
stop first at the Information Center in the former cavalry barracks.
Here information and free literature are provided and a variety of
publications are on sale. Some exhibits will aid you to visualize the
appearance and significance of the fort at various periods in its long
career. The structure is also being utilized temporarily for National
Park Service headquarters, utility shops, and residential units.</p>
<p>The cavalry barracks, as originally constructed in 1875, provided
quarters, kitchens, messhalls, washrooms, reading rooms, and other
facilities for two 60-man units of troops.</p>
<h3>2. THE SUTLER&rsquo;S STORE.</h3>
<p>Walking 100 yards southwest, past a commemorative
monument and the site of the sutler&rsquo;s residence, you reach the
sutler&rsquo;s store. Erected in 1849 or early 1850, the adobe section of
this structure housed a general store. The stone section was added
about 1852 and used in part as quarters for the sutler. During the
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
next three decades, many other additions were made, all of which had
disappeared by 1883. At that time, the present lime-concrete section
was constructed. This addition housed the officers&rsquo; club, storage rooms,
and a public saloon which connected with a poolroom in part of the
stone section. The balance of the stone section then housed the sutler&rsquo;s
office and the post office connecting with the original general store.
Operated by the sutler, or post trader as he was officially known after
1867, under a permit from the War Department, this versatile institution
served many notable western travelers, residents, and warriors&mdash;both
red and white&mdash;during its 40 active years.</p>

<h3>3. OFFICERS&rsquo; QUARTERS.</h3>
<p>With mansard roof and lime-concrete walls,
there stands next to the sutler&rsquo;s store the last officers&rsquo; quarters erected
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
at Fort Laramie in 1884. After the abandonment of the fort, it became
the home of the last post trader, John Hunton.</p>

<h3>4. OFFICERS&rsquo; QUARTERS.</h3>
<p>Next in &ldquo;Officers&rsquo; Row&rdquo; stands a lime-concrete
walled duplex. Erected during the building boom at Fort Laramie in
1875-76, it is typical of the officers&rsquo; quarters of that day.</p>
<h3><a id="no5">5. SITE OF BARRACKS.</a></h3>
<p>Turning your back to &ldquo;Officers&rsquo; Row,&rdquo; you
see the stone foundations of a long, three-company barracks erected
in 1868 which faced one end of the historic parade ground, and had
behind it messhalls and kitchens for each company.</p>

</div>
<h3>6. MAGAZINE.</h3>
<p>To the rear of &ldquo;Officers&rsquo; Row&rdquo; stands a rough stone-walled
structure originally built by 1850 as post magazine. In later
years it served as an outbuilding under several types of roofs.</p>
<h3>7. &ldquo;OLD BEDLAM.&rdquo;</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig27">

<p class="pcap"><i>Officers and children in front of now-missing units of officers&rsquo;

</div>
<p>Passing the sites of missing units of &ldquo;Officers&rsquo; Row,&rdquo;
you reach this two-storied frame structure which has dominated
the scene since the late summer of 1849, when it was partially
completed of lumber sawed locally by horsepower and millwork
hauled overland from Fort Leavenworth. While post headquarters&mdash;home
of the commanding officer until 1867 and often the stronghold
of bachelor officers&mdash;countless notables, including soldier, civilian, and
Indian sat at its dinner and council tables. It has been intimately associated
with many historic events, among the most dramatic of which
was John &ldquo;Portugee&rdquo; Phillips&rsquo; 236-mile, 4-day ride through December
blizzards with the news of the Fetterman disaster at Fort Phil Kearny
in 1866. Its brick-filled, clapboard walls echoing to historic tumult and
social gaiety, it early acquired the name &ldquo;Old Bedlam,&rdquo; which was
immortalized in Gen. Charles King&rsquo;s novel <i>Laramie, or the Queen
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
of Bedlam</i>, first published in 1889. As originally constructed, it had
side wings and outside stairways. These were removed and the present
rear wing added in 1881.</p>

</div>
<h3>8. OFFICERS&rsquo; QUARTERS RUINS.</h3>
<p>Three sets of crumbling lime-concrete
walls are all that remain of two commodious duplexes and a spacious
veranda-rimmed mansion for the commanding officer, which were
erected in 1881. They are stark reminders of the dismantling of many
fine buildings for lumber after the public auction of 1890.</p>
<h3>9. SITE OF FORT JOHN.</h3>
<p>Turning the corner of the parade ground by
the remains of a small brick fountain and passing the site of another
now-missing officers&rsquo; quarters, you reach the site of the fort built in
1841 by the American Fur Co. Located on high ground in a bend of
the Laramie River, it dominated the then treeless valley from bluff
to bluff. Many historians believe this was also the site of log-stockaded
Fort William, erected in 1834, but conclusive evidence as to its location
is lacking.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<h3>10. OFFICERS&rsquo; QUARTERS.</h3>
<p>Occupying part of the site of Fort John is a
large frame building used as officers&rsquo; quarters and built in 1870.
Originally designed for one family, it was later divided into a duplex
with two kitchen wings and verandas on three sides.</p>
<h3>11. ADMINISTRATION BUILDING RUINS.</h3>
<p>Turning the far corner of the
parade ground where once stood several minor buildings, including a
printing office, you reach the ruins of the fine administration building
erected in 1885 to house not only the headquarters offices but the post
theater and a schoolroom for officers&rsquo; children.</p>
<h3>12. OLD GUARDHOUSE.</h3>
<p>Facing the shallow stream, which is all that
modern irrigation reservoirs have left of the rushing Laramie River,
are the stone walls and barred windows and doors of the guardhouse,
or prison, built in 1866. The upper floor was used largely by the post
guard contingent, while prisoners, regardless of the degree of their
offense, languished in the basement room where remains of a solitary
cell suggests the probable harshness of military penal discipline.
Bricked-up windows and doorway are evidences of later use of this
structure for ordnance storage.</p>
<h3>13. SITE OF BARRACKS.</h3>
<p>The long, low mound on the southeast side of
the parade ground marks the site of another two-company barracks
behind which were kitchens and messhalls. These also were built in
1866.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig30">

</div>
<h3>14. NEW GUARDHOUSE RUINS.</h3>
<p>At the east angle of the parade ground
stands the walls of a guardhouse erected in 1876 to improve the lot of
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
both guards and prisoners. To the right are the foundations of the
general sink, and, to the left, the barracks foundations described under
<a href="#no5">No. 5</a>.</p>

its completion in 1885.</i> Courtesy U. S. Signal Corps.</p>
</div>
<h3>15. OLD BAKERY.</h3>
<p>One hundred yards to the east, this brick and lime-concrete
structure, built in 1876 to replace an earlier bakehouse, has
been restored to its condition as a granary, the use to which it was put
after 1885 when a new bakery, now in ruin to the east, was constructed.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>The restored commissary-storehouse, the old bakery, and

</div>
<h3>16. COMMISSARY STOREHOUSE.</h3>
<p>This large, lime-concrete walled structure
was erected in 1883 and included offices, issue rooms, and storerooms
for the variety of clothing, foodstuffs, and supplies controlled by
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
the commissary. In one large section of this structure are displayed
vehicles, implements, stoves, and furnishings, either relics of the fort
or acquisitions for eventual refurnishing of certain of the historic
structures.</p>
<p>You have now returned to the parking area and Information Center,
but may continue your tour to additional sites.</p>
<h3>17. HOSPITAL RUINS.</h3>
<p>On the hill to the north stand the ruins of the
post hospital erected in 1873. The hospital contained a 12-bed ward,
dispensary, kitchen, dining room, isolation rooms, surgeon&rsquo;s office,
rooms for orderlies and storage, but no laboratory or operating rooms.
It was the first lime-concrete building erected at Fort Laramie. There is
good evidence that this building stands in the midst of the Cemetery
used by the fur traders before 1849 and by the Army before 1868.
These early burials, probably including that of Milton Sublette in
1836, remain undisturbed.</p>
<h3>18. NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS&rsquo; QUARTERS RUIN.</h3>
<p>East of the hospital
is the ruin of a long, one-story building. Built in 1884, it consisted of
six four-room apartments for married noncommissioned staff Officers.</p>
<p>Looking west from &ldquo;Hospital Hill,&rdquo; you may gaze down on the
sites of the Cheyenne-Black Hills Stage Co.&rsquo;s stables and the Rustic
Hotel, another of the post trader&rsquo;s enterprises during the Black Hills
rush. Farther west stand the ruined walls of a sawmill-pumphouse
erected in 1887 to replace a predecessor destroyed by fire.</p>
<h3>OTHER POINTS OF INTEREST.</h3>
<p>Outside the present boundaries of the
national monument, but closely related to the historic fort, are several
other points of interest.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>The cavalry barracks, 1954, partially restored.</i></p>
</div>
<p>When approaching the fort, the visitor crosses the North Platte
River on a picturesque iron truss bridge which was built by the Army
in 1875-76 with materials hauled by ox team from Cheyenne. A short
distance above the bridge, on the south bank of the river, is the site
of old Fort Platte, rival of the second Fort Laramie (Fort John).
Farther on, to the left of the road, is a modern cemetery which includes
a few marked burials of soldiers and civilians of the late military
period. The remains of enlisted men once buried here, along with remains
of soldiers slain in the Grattan massacre, have been removed to
Fort McPherson National Cemetery in Nebraska.</p>
<p>Just beyond the boundary fence to the northeast, adjoining the
cavalry barracks and commissary storehouse, once stood numerous
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
utility shops, stables, corrals, the Indian agent&rsquo;s office, and the telegraph
office. On the opposite side of Laramie River were other structures
associated with the fort, including a laundresses&rsquo; quarters and
the Brown&rsquo;s Hotel.</p>
<p>In historic times there were various bridges across the Laramie for
the accommodation of soldiers and civilian travelers. The abutments
of one of these may still be seen to the east of the old bakery.</p>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small"><i>How to Reach Fort Laramie</i></span></h2>
<p>Fort Laramie National Monument is on a paved country road 3 miles
southwest of the town of Fort Laramie, Wyo., which is on U. S. 26
midway between its junctions with U. S. 85 and 87.</p>
<p>The Burlington Railroad and Bus Lines offer service to the town of
Fort Laramie, but there is no public transportation between the town
and the monument. You must arrange your own transportation
between these points.</p>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small"><i>Administration</i></span></h2>
<p>Fort Laramie National Monument is administered by the National
Park Service of the United States Department of the Interior. A
superintendent, whose address is Fort Laramie, Wyo., is in immediate
charge.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
